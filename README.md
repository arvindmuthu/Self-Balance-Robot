# Mr. Robot
_DIY study project_

## Description
Mr. Robot is a DIY project based on the self balance robot concept using sensors to get orientation (pitch, roll and yaw) and an PID controller to set the motor speed. Beside that, there are some additional features like wireless controllers by IP or bluetooth clients, computer vision functions like object tracking, video streaming to be used such as Google Cardboard VR for Android application and upcoming features.
