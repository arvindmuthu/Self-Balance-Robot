Raspberry PWM

There are two hardware PWM channels on the BCM2385/6.

PWM0, which can be set to use GPIOs 12, 18, 40, and 52. Only 12 (pin 32) and 18 (pin 12) are available on the B+/2B, 
and PWM1 which can be set to use GPIOs 13, 19, 41, 45 and 53. 
Only 13 is available on the B+/2B, on pin 35 (but I think PWM1 is used for something - is it the audio output?)

RPi.GPIO.PWM
(only sofware pwm, too much jitter)

WiringPI
(it is possible to use hw pwm, not Recommended to microservo)

Servoblaster
(very good pwm control, no jitter. Recommended to microservo)
